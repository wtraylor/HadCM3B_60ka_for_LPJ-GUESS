# Find the starting year for this particular file. Since the NetCDF files
# donâ€™t contain that information in their metadata, we need to derive it
# from the filename.
# The counting starts with `start_year==0` at the first HadCM3B simulation
# year, which is 60,000 years BP.
# For example the filename "regrid_downSol_Seaice_mm_s3_srf_2.5_5kyr.nc" will
# yield the first year 55000 (60ka - 5ka) and the last year 57500 (60ka -
# 2.5ka).
